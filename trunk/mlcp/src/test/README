*Configurations*

To run unit tests, the following configurations on MarkLogic Server are required:
1) MarkLogic Server runs on localhost
2) a XDBC server with port 5275 is required to associate with Documents database;
   use "/" for the root and the Modules database for modules.
3) create database "CopyDst"
4) create a forest, and attach it to database "CopyDst" 
5) create a XDBC server with port 6275 associated with database "CopyDst";
   use "/" for the root and the Modules database for modules.

[Unit Test for Dev]
1) Remove the comment mark around 'additionalClasspathElements' in pom.xml: maven-surefire-plugin to add log4j.properties in unit test classpath.
2) To pass the TestCopy:testCopyTemporalDocs and TestImportDocs:testImportTemporalDoc, it's required to create a graph (temporal collection) named "mycollection" in CopyDst database. See src/test/resources/createCollection.txt for example.
3) To pass the TestDistributedImportDocs:testImportTransformMixedDocs, it's required to enable triple index and collection lexicon on Document database.
4) Append "-DCONTENTPUMP_HOME=${path to mlcp}/mlcp/target/mlcp-1.4-lib" to maven command.

[Distributed]
hadoop runs on localhost

Check out mlcp source code to some directory, say MLCP_HOME.
Modify MLCP_HOME/src/conf/test.properties
1) set HADOOP_CONF_DIR to the hadoop's conf directory 
2) set OUT_PATH to some temporary path for output
3) set HADOOP to 2.6.0(depending on the version of your hadoop server)
4) set CONTENTPUMP_VERSION=1.3 or 1.4 (b8 is 1.3, trunk is 1.4)

[Run tests]
Run all tests on Linux:
first make sure HADOOP_CONF_DIR has been unset, then
mvn test -DskipTests=false

Run all tests (tests for distributed mode excluded) on Linux:
mvn test -DskipTests=false -Plocal

Run a specific test on Linux:
mvn test -DskipTests=false  -Dtest=TestImportDelimitedText

As Windows is not supported for mlcp distributed mode, use the following command to 
skip tests for distributed mode on Windows:
mvn.bat test -DskipTests=false -Plocal

By default, it will build and test using hadoop1's libraries; to test using hadoop2, append the following to the mvn command:
-Dhadoop-deps.version=2

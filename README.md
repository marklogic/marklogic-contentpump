# MarkLogic Content Pump and MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop

MarkLogic Content Pump (mlcp) is a command-line tool that provides the fastest way to import, export, and copy data to or from MarkLogic databases. Core features of mlcp include:

* Bulk load billions of local files
* Split and load large, aggregate XML files or delimited text
* Bulk load billions of triples or quads from RDF files
* Archive and restore database contents across environments
* Export data from a database to a file system
* Copy subsets of data between databases

You can run mlcp across many threads on a single machine or across many nodes in a cluster. Mlcp can now run against MarkLogic clusters hosted on AWS/Azure. 

The MarkLogic Connector for Hadoop is an extension to Hadoop’s MapReduce framework that allows you to easily and efficiently communicate with a MarkLogic database from within a Hadoop job. From 10.0-5, Hadoop Connector is removed from a separate release, but mlcp still uses Hadoop Connector as an internal dependency.
